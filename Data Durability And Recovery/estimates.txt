All the RDS AWS service need to basic resources from AWS. 
a) EC2 instances
b) EBS

Based on the above resources there can be 3 types of failure.
1) Recoverable EC2 instance failure - In this hardware failure occour of the EC2 instance that is used by RDS service.
RDS service tries to recover either the same instance or may be after couple of retry it spin up another RDS instance. During all this time RDS service is available.
RTO for this is 30 min since RDS service will take time to spin up new instance but RPO will remail 0 as EBS associated with the RDS service remain intact.

2) Non- Recoverable EC2 instance failure or EBS failure - In this scenario entire EC2 instance or EBS instance hit with a hardware failure.
In this scenario entire RDS service instance needs to launch. Launching new RDS instance will take only may be 5 min but then copy of the data from transaction logs from S3 to newly created RDS instance might take more than expected time sometime hours.

RTO for this kind of failure might be 5-15 min but then RPO will take time from 1 hr till unknow hours. i.e. based on the size of database.
