1) Minimuim RTO for a single AZ outage
In case of Single availablity zone there can only be automated back up possible. 
Also there can 3 types of failure.
a) Recoverable EBS volume failure:- Here RTO = 30 min.
b) Non- Recoverable EBS volume failure:- Here RTO = 30 min.
c) Availabilty Zone Failure:- RTO = 30 min.

2) Minimum RTO for a single region outage

If Database Replica is maintained then RTO will be zero because infrastructure can be configured to response an event to swithc DNS to point to replica DB. 
If Database Snapshot is being copied manually then time to recover will include creating new RDS instance from S3 snapshot. i.e. 30 min.


3) Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
Replica model: RPO = 0 min
Automated back up model: RPO = 5 min 
Manual Back up  : RPO = Last time whenever manual back up is being taken


4) Minimuim RPO for a single region outage
Replica model: RPO = 0 min
Automated back up model: RPO = 5 min 
Manual Back up  : RPO = Last time whenever manual back up is being taken
